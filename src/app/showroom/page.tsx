          <p>
            Vitrin Cabinetry&apos;s showroom is in Easton, Pennsylvania. You can see the full Vitrin Stock lineup on the
            floor, sit at the materials bench with wood, paint, and countertop samples, and meet a rep who knows the
            inventory and the lead times. The showroom is opening soon, and the exact street address is confirmed when
            you book — call <a href={`tel:${site.phone}`}>{site.phoneDisplay}</a> or email{" "}
            <a href={`mailto:${site.email}?subject=Showroom%20Visit`}>{site.email}</a> to arrange a visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vitrin serves Easton, Bethlehem, Allentown, and the wider Lehigh Valley and Bucks County. If you would
            rather see where the cabinetry is actually built, the <Link href="/shop-tour">workshop tour</Link> is the
            other half of the story.
