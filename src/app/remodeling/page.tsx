  {
    q: "How long does a kitchen remodel take in Bucks County?",
    a: "From signed contract to finished kitchen is typically 10–14 weeks: design lock, then 4–8 weeks of cabinet fabrication at our Easton bench, then 2–4 weeks on site covering demo, install, counters, backsplash, and finishing. Bathrooms are usually faster — commonly 3–6 weeks on site depending on tile scope.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need permits for a kitchen or bathroom remodel?",
    a: "If the project touches plumbing, electrical circuits, structural walls, or HVAC — usually yes. Cosmetic swaps typically don't. We coordinate with your municipality (Easton, Bethlehem, Allentown, and the surrounding townships all handle this slightly differently) and pull permits in your name when the scope requires it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I stay in my house during the remodel?",
    a: "Almost everyone does. For kitchens, we help you set up a temporary kitchen — fridge, microwave, coffee — outside the work zone, and we keep the dusty phase as short as possible by doing fabrication in our shop, not your driveway. Bathrooms are easier still if the house has a second full bath.",
  },
  {
    q: "What drives remodeling cost the most?",
    a: "Three things, in order: whether the layout changes (moving plumbing and walls costs more than replacing in place), the cabinetry tier, and the countertop material. Our quotes are line-item, so you can see each decision's price and trade down or up deliberately instead of guessing at an allowance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why hire a cabinet shop as the remodeler instead of a general contractor?",
    a: "Because in a kitchen or bath, the cabinetry is the schedule. It's the longest lead item, the most expensive line, and the thing every other trade works around. When the shop building the cabinets also runs the project, the design, fabrication, and site work stay on one calendar — and one company answers for the whole room, not just their slice of it.",

          <h2>The cabinetry is the schedule. We own both.</h2>
          <p>
            Every kitchen remodel in Bucks County is organized around one thing whether anyone admits it or not: when the cabinets arrive. It&apos;s the longest lead time, the biggest line on the budget, and the piece every other trade fits around. That&apos;s why a remodel run by the shop that builds the cabinets works differently — the design, the fabrication calendar, and the site schedule live in one place, a few minutes from your house.
