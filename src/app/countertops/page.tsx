  },

    title: "Granite",
    desc: "Natural stone, so no two slabs match — which is exactly why people choose it. Excellent heat resistance, and with modern sealers the old maintenance complaints are mostly history. You pick your actual slab before we cut it.",
  },
  {
    title: "Porcelain",

  { name: "Fabrication", text: "Your tops are cut, polished, and edge-profiled to the template — cutouts for sink, cooktop, and faucet included." },

  {
    q: "How long does countertop installation take?",
    a: "From template to installed tops is typically one to two weeks. The install itself is usually a single day for a standard kitchen. If we're supplying your cabinets too, we sequence both so the gap between cabinet install and countertop install is as short as possible.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you install countertops on cabinets you didn't build?",
    a: "Yes. Most of our countertop work goes on our own cabinetry, but we template and install on existing cabinets too — as long as the boxes are sound and level. If they aren't, we'll tell you before we cut stone, not after.",
  },
  {
    q: "Quartz vs. granite — which should I choose?",
    a: "Quartz for low maintenance and consistent color; granite for natural variation and heat resistance. In practice the decision usually comes down to the look you want next to your door style and floor — which is why we show slab samples next to cabinet doors at the showroom rather than in isolation.",
  },
  {
    q: "What affects countertop cost the most?",
    a: "Material tier first, then square footage, then details: edge profile, number of cutouts, seam count, and backsplash height. A straightforward quartz kitchen and an exotic-slab kitchen with a waterfall island can differ by thousands. We quote line-item, so you see exactly where the money goes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you do backsplashes as well?",
    a: "Yes — 4-inch matching splash, full-height stone or porcelain, or tile installed after the tops are in. If you're planning tile, we'll coordinate so the splash lands correctly against window trim and upper cabinets.",

            The countertop is the last big decision in a kitchen and the first thing everyone touches. We template after the cabinets are set, fabricate to the template, and install with the same crew accountability as our cabinetry — across Easton, Bethlehem, Allentown, and the greater Lehigh Valley.

          <h2>Why buy countertops from a cabinet shop?</h2>
          <p>
            Because the most common countertop problems aren&apos;t stone problems — they&apos;re sequencing problems. Tops templated before the cabinets were level. A seam landing in the worst possible spot because nobody looked at the cabinet layout. An overhang that doesn&apos;t clear the drawer bank. When the same shop is responsible for the boxes and the tops, those problems get caught on paper instead of in your kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            We supply countertops two ways: paired with a <Link href="/cabinets/custom">Vitrin Signature</Link> or <Link href="/cabinets/stock">Vitrin Stock</Link> cabinet order on one schedule, or as a standalone replacement on cabinets you already own. Either way, you pick the material at our Easton showroom next to real door samples — not from a laminate chip under fluorescent light.

                  A countertop is only as good as its template. That&apos;s why ours happen on site, after cabinets are installed and shimmed level — and why we won&apos;t quote a firm seam layout until we&apos;ve seen the room.
