  {
    q: "What makes a Vitrin closet different from a franchise closet system?",
    a: "Materials and fit. Most closet franchises sell 5/8-inch melamine panels in fixed increments, drilled at a factory somewhere else. We build closets the way we build kitchen cabinets: plywood construction, real drawer boxes with soft-close hardware, scribed to your walls — which in an older Bucks County home are rarely straight. You also deal with the people who build it, not a sales rep working on commission.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you really design the closet in 3D before building?",
    a: "Yes. Every custom closet starts with measurements of your space and an inventory conversation — how much double-hang, long-hang, folded storage, and shoes you actually own. You review a 3D rendering and approve the layout before anything gets cut.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a custom closet take?",
    a: "Design takes a week or two depending on revisions. Build time at our Easton bench is typically two to four weeks, and installation is usually a single day for a reach-in or pantry, one to two days for a large walk-in.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a custom closet worth it for a reach-in?",
    a: "Usually, yes — reach-ins are where the default builder-grade single rod wastes the most space. A drawer bank and a double-hang section can eliminate the need for a dresser in the room, which often matters more in smaller bedrooms than in the primary suite.",
  },
  {
    q: "Painted or wood-tone finishes?",
    a: "Both. Painted closets get the same bath-rated lacquer we use on vanities. Wood-tone builds run from clear-sealed maple to stained white oak and walnut. Two-tone — painted carcass, wood drawer fronts — is the current favorite in walk-ins.",

          <h2>A closet is a cabinet. So we build it like one.</h2>
          <p>
            Most &quot;custom&quot; closets are wire racks or factory-drilled melamine panels cut to standard increments. They work — until a drawer slide gives out or the panel edges start to chip, and you discover nobody local built it and nobody local fixes it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vitrin closets come off the same bench as our <Link href="/cabinets/custom">custom kitchens</Link>: plywood carcasses, dovetail or doweled drawer boxes, soft-close hardware, finishes applied in a dust-controlled room. They&apos;re scribed to your walls during installation — which matters in the older housing stock around Easton, Bethlehem, and Allentown, where a &quot;flat&quot; wall can wander half an inch across a closet run. If you&apos;ve seen our <Link href="/cabinets/built-ins">built-ins</Link>, you already know the construction.

          <h2>How a Vitrin closet comes together.</h2>
          <p>
            It starts with an inventory conversation, not a catalog. How much double-hang versus long-hang do you own? Do shoes live here or at the door? Is the goal to eliminate a dresser? From there we measure the space, draw the closet in 3D, and revise until the layout is right. You approve the rendering before anything is cut. Build time at the bench is two to four weeks; installation is usually a day.
