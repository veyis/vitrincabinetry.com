  },
  {
    q: "Does inset cabinetry have problems in a humid climate?",
    a: "It can. In a place like Bucks County with seasonal humidity swings, inset doors will move a few thousandths of an inch between summer and winter — sometimes enough to create a small visible gap. A good shop builds for that movement (selecting wood, sealing correctly, allowing the right tolerance). A bad shop ignores it and you end up with doors that stick or gap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I mix inset and full-overlay in the same kitchen?",
    a: "It's done — sometimes inset for the perimeter and full-overlay for the island, or vice versa. We don't usually recommend it because the visual mismatch fights itself. Pick one for the whole room.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about beaded inset?",
    a: "Beaded inset adds a small decorative bead around the door opening. It's a more period-correct, more formal look — almost always seen in traditional kitchens. Adds to inset pricing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is full-overlay the same as frameless?",
    a: "No. Full-overlay covers most of the face frame but the frame is still there underneath. Frameless construction (also called European) eliminates the face frame entirely and screws the door directly to the cabinet box. Frameless gives you the maximum storage and the cleanest modern look. We build both.",

            <p>
              <strong>Inset</strong> doors sit flush inside the cabinet frame. The frame is visible around every door. The look is traditional, crafted, formal — what most people mean when they say &quot;furniture-grade cabinetry.&quot; It costs more than full-overlay because the construction tolerance is much tighter.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Full-overlay</strong> doors sit on the face of the cabinet, covering the frame. The look is clean, contemporary, modern. The frame mostly disappears behind the doors. Cost is the baseline; storage is slightly better; seasonal wood movement is invisible.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Frameless</strong> (sometimes called European) is full-overlay with the frame removed entirely. Maximum storage. Cleanest modern look. Same baseline cost as full-overlay.

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: "2.5rem", marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>When full-overlay is the right answer</h2>

              <li>Modern or transitional-modern kitchen.</li>

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: "2.5rem", marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>A note on construction quality</h2>
            <p>
              Inset construction punishes a bad shop. Because every door must fit a precise opening, any sloppiness in the box build shows up immediately as a misaligned door or an uneven reveal. If a shop is selling cheap inset, the corners are almost certainly being cut somewhere — either in the wood selection, the joinery, or the finishing prep.
            </p>
            <p>
              Full-overlay forgives more. Small variations get hidden by the door overlap. This is part of why full-overlay is the standard for catalog cabinet lines — the manufacturing process can tolerate the variance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Real-world rule: a great shop builds either style well. A mediocre shop only does full-overlay convincingly. Ask to see a year-old inset job before you sign for one.
