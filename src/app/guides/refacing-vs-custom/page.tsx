  {
    q: "Is refacing really half the price of new cabinets?",
    a: "Sometimes. National refacing companies advertise big savings, and on a like-for-like kitchen with stock-grade replacement, the math can work out in refacing's favor. But the comparison is rarely like-for-like — refacing keeps your old boxes, layout, and storage, while a custom replacement gives you all three of those redesigned. Compare total value, not just sticker.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does refacing last?",
    a: "The doors and veneer themselves usually hold up well. The original boxes underneath are the limiting factor — if those are particle-board with worn-out hinges and damaged drawer slides, you're putting expensive new fronts on tired infrastructure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I reface and change the layout?",
    a: "Generally no. Refacing keeps the existing boxes in place — that's where the savings come from. If you want to move the range, add an island, or change cabinet sizes, you're really asking for new cabinetry, not refacing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer refacing?",
    a: "No. Vitrin is a custom cabinetry shop — we build new cabinets from scratch. If refacing is the right answer for your project, we'll tell you so and point you toward a reputable refacing contractor. Honest match-making matters more than booking the wrong job.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the typical Bucks County price difference?",
    a: "A refacing job on a standard 10x12 kitchen runs roughly $10k–$20k. A custom replacement of the same kitchen runs $30k–$55k for our Studio Semi-Custom tier and $55k+ for full Signature Custom. The decision usually isn't whether you can afford one vs. the other — it's whether the refaced kitchen actually fixes what's wrong with the current one.",

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>The 30-second answer</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Reface when:</strong> Your existing cabinet boxes are solid, the layout works, you like the bones of the kitchen, and you just want a refreshed surface look. Most refacing jobs that work out well start with kitchens less than 20 years old, with plywood (not particle-board) carcasses and a layout the family is already happy with.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Replace when:</strong> The existing boxes are tired, the layout is wrong, you want different storage, drawer banks where doors used to be, an island that wasn&apos;t there before, integrated panels on appliances, or any door style your refacer can&apos;t produce. Custom replacement is the right answer most of the time — but not all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The math nobody mentions:</strong> Refacing&apos;s real savings come from skipping demolition, electrical, plumbing, and counters. Once a refacing project starts touching any of those, the gap closes fast.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: "3rem", marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>What refacing actually is</h2>
            <p>
              Refacing keeps your existing cabinet boxes in place. The doors and drawer fronts come off and get replaced with new ones. The visible sides of the cabinets get a thin veneer applied. Hardware (hinges, pulls) sometimes gets replaced. Counters and appliances stay where they are.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pitch is &quot;new kitchen look for half the price.&quot; The reality is &quot;new doors and a veneer wrap over whatever you had.&quot; That can be a great deal — or a waste of money — depending on what you had.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: "3rem", marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>What custom replacement actually is</h2>
            <p>
              Custom replacement means new cabinet boxes, new drawers, new hardware, new doors. The opportunity is full redesign — drawer banks instead of base cabinets, full-extension hardware, soft-close everything, integrated appliance panels, custom storage cubbies sized to your dishes. You can also change layout: add an island, move the range, expand the pantry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The trade-off is cost and time — typically two to four times the price of a comparable refacing job, and a longer schedule. The win is a kitchen that actually fits how you live.

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: "2.5rem", marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>A note about Kitchen Magic and the national refacers</h2>
            <p>
              The national refacing companies are real businesses with decent products. Kitchen Magic, the dominant refacer in this region, has been doing this for forty years and has a workmanlike record. If refacing is genuinely the right answer for your project, they will probably do a fine job.
            </p>
            <p>
              What they will not do is tell you when refacing is the wrong answer. Their sales pitch is engineered around closing a refacing sale, not steering you to a different solution. That&apos;s not malice — it&apos;s how their business model works. So if you&apos;re considering refacing, get a custom-replacement quote from a real cabinet shop alongside it. Compare the two in light of the table above, and pick the right tool for the actual job.
