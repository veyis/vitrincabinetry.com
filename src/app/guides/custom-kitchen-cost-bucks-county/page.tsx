const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Why is custom more expensive than the franchise quotes I've been getting?",
    a: "Franchise kitchen companies sell a manufactured catalog cabinet line and subcontract installation. Their pricing reflects that — bulk-discounted product, low-margin install, profit on volume. Custom cabinetry is built one project at a time, by a small team, with materials we buy at smaller scale. The trade is real craft and full layout freedom for higher cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does an average Bucks County kitchen actually cost in 2026?",
    a: "Across the projects we delivered in 2025, our median total was around $68,000, including cabinets, counters, and installation but not appliances. Our 25th percentile was $48,000 and our 75th percentile was $89,000.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I lower the cost without losing the custom feel?",
    a: "Yes. The biggest dial: stay in the Studio Semi-Custom tier. Use paint-grade species instead of premium woods. Keep door style to flat-panel or shaker. Use mid-tier hardware. Skip integrated appliance panels. Make those four choices and a 30-cabinet kitchen drops $15,000–$25,000.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer financing?",
    a: "Yes — through Wisetack, with 0% promotional terms available on qualifying projects. Most of our clients pay in three milestone draws (deposit, fabrication, completion) directly to us; financing is there if it helps the cash flow.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are deposits structured?",
    a: "Typical structure: 10% to lock the design slot, 40% on shop start, 40% on shop completion, 10% on final walkthrough. Every project is contracted in writing with milestone-based draws.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you do free quotes?",
    a: "Discovery calls (30 minutes by phone) are free. In-home surveys (60–90 minutes) are free. Full line-item written proposals after design are part of the project — included if you sign, $500 standalone if you don't (credited back if you proceed later).",

            No competitor in this region publishes pricing. We do — because the &quot;call for quote&quot; game wastes everyone&apos;s time. Here&apos;s what custom kitchens actually cost in Bucks County in 2026.

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>The 30-second answer</h2>
            <p>
              Most full custom kitchens in Bucks County cost between <strong>$45,000 and $90,000</strong>, including cabinetry, counters, and installation. Budget kitchens land lower, in the <strong>$30,000–$45,000</strong> range. Luxury kitchens with integrated appliances and exotic species start at <strong>$95,000</strong> and routinely run past <strong>$150,000</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest variables are cabinet count, door style, wood species, hardware suite, and whether your appliances are getting integrated panels. The rest is detail.

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>Where the comparison shops will quote you</h2>
            <p>
              For perspective: a franchise-catalog kitchen from a competitor will often quote below our Signature Custom tier. The cost gap reflects the catalog cabinet line vs. bench-built construction, and the subcontracted installer vs. in-house team. Whether that gap is worth it depends entirely on what you&apos;re trying to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the other end, a refacing job on the same kitchen footprint runs <strong>$10,000–$20,000</strong>. We&apos;ve written a separate guide on <Link href="/guides/refacing-vs-custom" className="text-link">refacing vs. custom replacement</Link> if that&apos;s where your decision actually sits.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginTop: "2.5rem", marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>What to ask any cabinet shop quoting you</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Are these cabinets built in-house, or are they a manufactured line you resell?</li>
              <li>Is the installer your employee or a subcontractor?</li>
              <li>Will I get a line-item proposal showing door style, wood species, hardware brand, and cabinet count?</li>
              <li>What is the lead time from contract signed to install start?</li>
              <li>What is the warranty, and does it transfer when I sell the home?</li>
              <li>What scope is *not* in the quote (counters, plumbing, electrical, tile, demo, appliances)?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If any of those answers come back vague, that&apos;s the signal. A real custom shop can answer all six in 30 seconds.
