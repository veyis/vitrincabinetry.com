const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Should flooring go in before or after the cabinets?",
    a: "It depends on the floor. Hardwood and tile usually go in first, with cabinets set on top. Floating floors like most LVP should not be pinned under cabinets — they need to move, so cabinets go in first and the floor is cut to them. Because we supply both, we sequence this correctly instead of leaving two contractors to argue about it in your kitchen.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the best flooring for a kitchen remodel?",
    a: "For most families: LVP for waterproof durability, or engineered hardwood if you want real wood with better moisture stability. Solid hardwood is beautiful but less forgiving of dishwasher leaks and dropped stock pots. We'll show you all three next to your cabinet door sample so you choose with your eyes, not a brochure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you match new flooring to existing floors in the rest of the house?",
    a: "Often, yes. With hardwood we can match species, plank width, and stain, then feather the transition. With LVP and engineered products we work from manufacturer lines wide enough to get close. Where a perfect match isn't realistic, we'll recommend a deliberate transition instead of a near-miss.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a flooring installation take?",
    a: "A typical room is one to three days. A whole first floor is usually under a week, plus acclimation time for wood products — hardwood needs to sit in your house several days before installation so it stabilizes at your home's humidity. We build that into the schedule instead of skipping it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do older Lehigh Valley homes need special prep?",
    a: "Frequently. Upper Bucks housing stock ranges from 1800s stone farmhouses with uneven subfloors to post-war ranches with plywood that needs refastening. Skipping subfloor prep is the number-one cause of squeaks, cracked tile, and lifting planks — so we assess it during the estimate, not after demo day.",

          <p>
            The floor and the cabinets meet at a hundred points in a kitchen — toe kicks, appliance openings, transitions, thresholds. When one contractor installs the floor and another sets the cabinets, that seam is where the finger-pointing lives. We install both, so the sequencing question (floors first or cabinets first — the answer depends on the floor) gets decided once, on paper, by the people responsible for both outcomes.

          <h2>Upper Bucks floors have upper Bucks problems.</h2>
          <p>
            The housing across the Lehigh Valley isn&apos;t uniform, and neither are its subfloors. Easton and Bethlehem rowhomes from the early 1900s often hide narrow-strip pine or oak under decades of carpet. The postwar ranches and split-levels around Allentown and Palmer Township tend to have plywood subfloors that need refastening before anything goes on top — squeaks are the giveaway. And the older stone homes scattered from Forks to the Saucon Valley move with the seasons in ways that punish rigid flooring choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this is a problem if it&apos;s diagnosed before installation. All of it is a problem after. Our estimates start with the subfloor, because that&apos;s where flooring jobs are actually won or lost.
