          <h2 className="section-heading" style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.8rem" }}>What accessibility cabinetry actually means</h2>
          <p>
            The standard kitchen is built around an assumed user: 5&apos;6&quot;–6&apos;0&quot; tall, full hand strength, full balance, good vision. That assumption holds for most of life. It stops holding for almost everyone eventually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aging-in-place cabinetry is not a hospital-room aesthetic. The finished kitchen reads as a well-built custom kitchen — same door styles, same finish options, same hardware tier as anything else we supply. The accessibility choices are in the layout, the drawer mix, the hardware function, and the lighting design. None of them read as &quot;accessibility features.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of these choices are also better cabinetry regardless of age. A kitchen with drawer banks instead of lower-door cabinets is easier to use at any stage. Lever pulls outperform round knobs every time. Layered lighting is just good lighting. The accessibility-driven spec tends to be the better spec.
