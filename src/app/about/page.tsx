            Vitrin Cabinetry is a hands-on cabinet shop in Easton, PA. Vitrin Signature kitchens are drawn, built, and finished at our bench — then delivered by us, installed by our crew or yours. Vitrin Stock is a curated in-shop lineup for faster projects, still backed by the same team. No franchise. No disappearing act after the sale.

          <h3>Why we exist</h3>
          <p>
            The cabinetry buyer in Bucks County and the Lehigh Valley is often stuck between two extremes: a semi-custom showroom that optimizes for catalog SKUs and outsourced install, or a luxury design-build firm with a months-long queue. Vitrin sits in the middle — a real Easton shop where Signature work is bench-built to your dimensions, Stock is on the floor when you need speed, pricing tiers are published, and timelines are what we&apos;d want quoted to our own families.
          </p>

          <h3>The shop</h3>
          <p>
            Our workshop is in Easton. It is where every Vitrin cabinet is built. Inside, you&apos;ll find a CNC for joinery accuracy, a hand-bench for the parts a machine should never touch, a dust-controlled finishing room, and racks of solid hardwood waiting to become someone&apos;s kitchen. We invite every prospective client to walk through it. What you see is what builds your project.
          </p>

          <h3>The team</h3>
          <p>
            Vitrin is intentionally small. The same person who draws your cabinet layout helps measure the space, watches every piece go through the bench, and is present the day it goes in. One shop, a handful of people — sometimes the same person filling more than one role. That is the entire point. There is nobody for accountability to land on but us.
          </p>

          <h3>What we believe</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom should mean custom.</strong> Not 50 stock colors. Real bench-built cabinets, drawn to your dimensions, finished how you want them.</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing should be transparent.</strong> Line-item proposals. Tiered ranges published on the website. No mystery-shopper games.</li>
            <li><strong>Installers should be the builders.</strong> The same hands. Every time.</li>
            <li><strong>Timelines should be honest.</strong> Four to eight weeks in the shop. One to two weeks on site. We tell you what we know and we update you weekly.</li>
            <li><strong>The warranty should be the team&apos;s, not a manufacturer&apos;s.</strong> Our lifetime cabinetry warranty stands as long as you own the home.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Where we work</h3>
          <p>
            We install across {site.areaServed.slice(0, 8).map((t) => t.replace(", PA", "")).join(", ")} and the rest of the Lehigh Valley and upper Bucks. Our shop is in Easton — most clients live within a 25-minute drive of it.
