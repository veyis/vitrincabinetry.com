  // GBP switch-on checklist. Vitrin has no Google Business Profile yet

  // search radius). Nothing below is hardcoded on purpose — a `sameAs` that
  // points at a profile which does not resolve is worse than no `sameAs`.
  // The day the GBP goes live, set these in Vercel (Production + Preview) and
  // redeploy; src/lib/schema.ts picks them up with no code change:
  //   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PROFILE_URL  Maps place URL -> sameAs + hasMap
  //   NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_URL        profile URL    -> sameAs
  //   NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_URL       profile URL    -> sameAs
  //   NEXT_PUBLIC_HOUZZ_URL           profile URL    -> sameAs
  //   NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_STREET     street address -> streetAddress in
  //     PostalAddress (omitted while `address.street` still starts with "TBD")
  // Then: set `gbpName` to match the listing character-for-character, align
  // `hours` with the GBP, update `geo` to the real coordinates, and enable
  // `aggregateRating` only once there are >= 10 real reviews.
